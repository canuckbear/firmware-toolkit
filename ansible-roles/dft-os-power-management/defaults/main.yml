# Defines th default value for gouvernor. Available values are defined in
#  cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
#
# Values can be :
#   ; conservative      The CPUfreq governor "conservative", much like the "ondemand"
#                       governor, sets the CPU frequency depending on the current usage.  It
#                       differs in behaviour in that it gracefully increases and decreases the
#                       CPU speed rather than jumping to max speed the moment there is any load
#                       on the CPU. This behaviour is more suitable in a battery powered
#                       environment.
#
#   . ondemand          The CPUfreq governor "ondemand" sets the CPU frequency depending
#                       on the current system load.The CPU must have the capability to switch the
#                       frequency very quickly.
#
#   . performance       The CPUfreq governor "performance" sets the CPU statically to the
#                       highest frequency within the borders of scaling_min_freq and
#                       scaling_max_freq.
#
#   . powersave         sets the CPU statically to the lowest frequency within
#                       the borders of scaling_min_freq and scaling_max_freq.
#
#   . userspace         The CPUfreq governor "userspace" allows the user, or any userspace
#                       program running with UID "root", to set the CPU to a specific frequency
#                       by making a sysfs file "scaling_setspeed" available in the CPU-device
#                       directory.
