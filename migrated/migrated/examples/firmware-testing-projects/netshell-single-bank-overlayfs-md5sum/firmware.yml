# Definition of the firmware layout
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
layout:
  # Method to use to assembl the systm in memory. Can be either aufs
  # or overlayfs
  method: overlayfs

  # Definition of the different things to stack to assemble the firmware
  stack_definition:
    # Stack items are individual element of the stack. They are processed
    # and added to the aufs o overlayfs according to their order of
    # definition
  - stack_item:
      # Name under which the item is known and used in the scripts
      # Name is used to mount the item in host filesystem under /mnt/dft/name
      name: system

      # Type of the 'source' to use for this mountpoint. It can be :
      # squashfs, partition, or tmpfs. This information is mandatory
      type: squashfs

      # Path to the squashfs file to mount
      # This information is ignored if type is ot squashfs
      # Default value is generated based upon the project information
      squashfs_file: system.fw

      # Name of the partition device to mount when type is partition
      # This information is ignored if type is not partition
      # There is no default vallue ( it's too dangerous too guess that  :) )
      # partition:

      # Path under which this object has to be mounted in the host file
      # This information is mandatory
      mountpoint: /

      # Options to pass to the mount command.
      # Default is TODO
      # mount_options:

    # Defines a tmpfs to stack over the root
  - stack_item:
      # Name of the mount point
      name: volatile

      # Item type (tmpfs, partition or squashfs)

# Definition of the firmware security parameters
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
security:
  # Defines security paramters such as the use of hash, digital ignature, etc.
  # TODO  not at start, but need to check for hashes or signatures
  # TODO  how to handle ciphering, keygen, secure storage
  hash_method: md5sum

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Definition of the firmware resilience and safety parameters
#
# Remember that Safety is not security
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
resilience:
  # Number of banks used ifor firmware installation
  banks: 1

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Definition of the squashfs parameters
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
configuration:

  # Defines the block size. Default is 131072 bytes
