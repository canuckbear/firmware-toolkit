# Definition of the firmware layout
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
layout:
  # Method to use to assembl the systm in memory. Can be either aufs 
  # or overlayfs
  method: overlayfs

  # Definition of the different things to stack to assemble the firmware
  stack-definition:
    # Stack items are individual element of the stack. They are processed
    # and added to the aufs o overlayfs according to their order of
    # definition
  - stack-item:
      # Name under which the item is known and used in the scripts
      # Name is used to mount the item in host filesystem under /mnt/dft/name
      name: system

      # Type of the 'source' to use for this mountpoint. It can be :
      # squashfs, partition, or tmpfs. This information is mandatory
      type: squashfs

      # Path to the squashfs file to mount
      # This information is ignored if type is ot squashfs
      # Default value is generated based upon the project information
      squashfs-file: system.fw

      # Name of the partition device to mount when type is partition
      # This information is ignored if type is not partition
      # There is no default vallue ( it's too dangerous too guess that  :) )
      # partition:

      # Path under which this object has to be mounted in the host file 
      # This information is mandatory
      mountpoint: /

      # Options to pass to the mount command.
      # Default is TODO
      # mount-options:

    # Defines a tmpfs to stack over the root 
  - stack-item:
      # Name of the mount point

# TODO name + stack_over ?

# TODO globa  l ?
  auto-commit: False
#   defines mapping over squashfs
#   => direct write ?
# stacking ? 
# how to define cow ?

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Definition of the firmware security parameters
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
security:
  # Defines security paramters such as the use of hash, digital ignature, etc.
  # TODO  not at start, but need to check for hashes or signatures
  # TODO  how to handle ciphering, keygen, secure storage
  hash-method: none

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Definition of the firmware resilience and safety parameters
#
# Remember that Safety is not security  
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
resilience:
  # Number of banks used ifor firmware installation
  banks: 1

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Definition of the squashfs parameters
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
configuration:

  # Defines the block size. Default is 131072 bytes
  block-size: "256K"

  # Compressors available are gzip (default), lzo, xz
  compressor: "xz"

  # Don't make the filesystem exportable via NFS. 
  # no-exports: True

  # xattrs: False

  # Do not compress inode table. Default is False
  # no-inode-compression: True

  # Do not compress data blocks. Default is False
  # no-datablock-compression: True

  # Do not compress fragment blocks. Default is False
  # no-fragment-compression: True

  # Do not compress extended attributes. Default is False
  # no-xattrs-compression: True

  # Use or not fragments.
  # use-fragments: True

  # Do not perform duplicate checking.
  # no-duplicates-check: True

  # Make all files owned by root.
  # all-root: False

  # Set all file uids to uid.
  # force-uid: "1234"

  # Set all file gids to gid.
  # force-gid: "1234"

  # Do not pad filesystem to a multiple of 4K.
  # nopad: True


#        -keep-as-directory
#            if  one source directory is specified, create a root directory contain‐
#            ing that directory, rather than the contents of the directory.

#    Filesystem filter options
#        -p PSEUDO_DEFINITION
#            Add pseudo file definition.

#        -pf PSEUDO_FILE
#            Add list of pseudo file definitions.

#        -sort SORT_FILE
#            sort files according to priorities in SORT_FILE. One file or  dir  with
#            priority per line. Priority -32768 to 32767, default priority 0.

#        -ef EXCLUDE_FILE
#            list of exclude dirs/files. One per line.

#        -wildcards
#            Allow  extended  shell  wildcards  (globbing)  to  be  used  in exclude
#            dirs/files

#        -regex
#            Allow POSIX regular expressions to be used in exclude dirs/files.

#    Filesystem append options
#        -noappend
#            do not append to existing filesystem.

#        -root-becomes NAME
#            when appending source files/directories, make the original root  become
#            a  subdirectory in the new root called NAME, rather than adding the new
#            source items to the original root.
