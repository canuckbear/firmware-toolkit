<h1>Ansible roles naming convention
</h1>
This folder contains the Ansible roles provided by the DFT project.
Roles are named according the following rules.

A role name is made of three components or fields which are dashed separated. The fields are :

* The name of the project it belongs to.
  * DFT roles always use 'dft' as first component value.

* The category of the role. Categories identified so far are :
  * apps (local software applications)
  * bsp (drivers and hardware support)
  * devel (development and compilers)
  * os (operating system and unix system itself)
  * network
  * security
  * webapps (web and remote software applications)
  * xde (X Desktop Environment)
*  The role software functionality
    * Definitions coming soon...
