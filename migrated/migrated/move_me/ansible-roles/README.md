<h1>Ansible roles naming convention
</h1>
This folder contains the Ansible roles provided by the DFT project.
Roles are named according the following rules.

A role name is made of three components or fields which are dashed separated. The fields are :
* The name of the project it belongs to (ie dft)
  DFT role names are always prefixed by 'dft' as first field value

* The category of the role. Roles are available for the following categories:
  * apps (local software applications)
  * bsp (drivers and hardware support)
  * devel (development and compilers)
  * os (operating system and unix system itself)
  * network
  * security
  * webapps (web and remote software applications)
  * xde (X Desktop Environment)
* The role software functionality
  * Definitions coming soon...
