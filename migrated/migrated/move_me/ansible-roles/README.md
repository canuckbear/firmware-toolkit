<h1>Ansible roles naming convention
</h1>
This folder contains the Ansible roles provided by the DFT project. Roles are named according the following rules :

A role name is made of three components or fields (fields are dashed separated) :
<ul>
  <li>The name of the project it belongs to. DFT roles will, of course, always use 'dft' as first component value.
  <li>The category of the role. Categories identified so far are :
  <ul>
    <li>os</li>
    <li>devel</li>
    <li>bsp</li>
    <li>network</li>
    <li>security</li>
    <li>desktop</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <li>The role software functionality
  </li>
