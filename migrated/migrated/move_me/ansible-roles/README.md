#Ansible roles naming convention

This folder contains the Ansible roles provided by the DFT project. Roles are named according the following rules :

A role name is made of three components or fields (fields are dashed separated) :
  <ul>The name of the project it belongs to. DFT roles will, of course, always use 'dft' as first component value.
  <ul>The category of the role. Category identified so far are :
      <ul>os
      <ul>devel
      <ul>bsp
      <ul>network
      <ul>security
      <ul>desktop
  </ul>

  <ul>The role software functionality
  </ul>ul>
