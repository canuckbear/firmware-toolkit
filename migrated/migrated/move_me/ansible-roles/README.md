#Ansible roles naming convention

This folder contains the Ansible roles provided by the DFT project. Roles are named according the following rules :

A role name is made of three components or fields (fields are dashed separated) :
  - The name of the project it belongs to. DFT roles will, of course, always use 'dft' as first component value.
  - The category of the role. Category identified so far are :
    --os
    --devel
    --bsp
    --network
    --security
    --desktop

  - The role software functionality
