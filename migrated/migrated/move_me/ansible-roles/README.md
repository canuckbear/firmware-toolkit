<h1>Ansible roles naming convention
</h1>
This folder contains the Ansible roles provided by the DFT project. Roles are named according the following rules :

A role name is made of three components or fields (fields are dashed separated) :
  <ul>The name of the project it belongs to. DFT roles will, of course, always use 'dft' as first component value.
  <ul>The category of the role. Category identified so far are :
      <ul>os</ul>
      <ul>devel</ul>
      <ul>bsp</ul>
      <ul>network</ul>
      <ul>security</ul>
