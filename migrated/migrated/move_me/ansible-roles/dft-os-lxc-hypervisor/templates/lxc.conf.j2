NAME
       lxc.conf - Configuration files for LXC.

DESCRIPTION
       LXC configuration is split in two parts. Container configuration and system configuration.

   CONTAINER CONFIGURATION
       The container configuration is held in the config stored in the container's directory.

       A  basic  configuration  is generated at container creation time with the default's recommended for the chosen
       template as well as extra default keys coming from the default.conf file.

       That default.conf file is either located at /etc/lxc/default.conf or for unprivileged  containers  at  ~/.con‐
       fig/lxc/default.conf.

       Details about the syntax of this file can be found in: lxc.container.conf(5)

   SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
       The  system  configuration is located at /etc/lxc/lxc.conf or ~/.config/lxc/lxc.conf for unprivileged contain‐
       ers.

       This configuration file is used to set values such as default lookup paths and storage  backend  settings  for
       LXC.

       Details about the syntax of this file can be found in: lxc.system.conf(5)
