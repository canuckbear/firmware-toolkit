# This Ansible managed file and has been automatically generated on {{ ansible_date_time.date }} {{ ansible_date_time.time }}

# Therefore, please do not edit this file by hand. You should instead update the inventory
# and redeploy roles on {{ ansible_host }}. When being redeployed by ansible-playbook, managed
# files will be overriden. Thus, any local and manual modification will be lost.
# It's up to the sysadmin to update the inventory files first.
# New variables delared in inventory will be added, undeclared ones (or no longer declared) removed.
