# Defines the architecture used by the board. It has to be a valid Debian architecture
# like amd64, i386, armhf, mips, ...
#
# Only one architecture can be set at a time, if a board can support several architecture
# armel and armhf, or armhf and arm64, then you need to create several bsp definition file,
# one for each architecture
architecture: armhf

# The kernel section defines the different parameters needed to select and install the kernel
# used to boot the board. It is defined by a source (Debian repository) and a list of packages
# to install (ie: packages containing kernel, dtb, firmware)
#
# Several packages repository are defined in DFT tool and can be used as is. The valid values are
# debian, armbian, devuan and custom. Custom repository can be used, but URL is mandatory
# and must be defined.
#
#kernel:
  # Defines the upstream site used to provide kernel for this device
#  origin: armwizard

  # Defines the public key of the repository if not using default value.
  # Default keys are :

#  packages:
#    - linux-image-kernel-raspberry-pi2
#    - linux-image-firmware-raspberry-pi2
#    - linux-image-dtb-raspberry-pi2

#TODO: add flag to define if a specific source list ha to be generated under sources.list.define

# The uboot section defines the different parameters needed to select and install the uboot
# used for this board. In some (rare) case, the uboot can include severa binaries, thus this
# sections defines a list of binary files to copy to the target image, the copy method to use, and
# its parameters.
# uboot:
#   - {
#       # Identification the target image file. This has to be one of the filename defined in the
#       # image.yml configuration file
#       target_image: "xxx.image" ,

#       # method used to copy the binary to the target image. Valid values are :
#       #  . dd
#       method: "dd" ,

#       # Binary to copy to the target image. Binaries are stored under...
#       binary: "xxx" ,

#       # Copy method parameters. The valid value depends on the method used. You should refer to the
#       # man page of the tool used by the selected method. parameters will be passed to this tool.
#       #
#       # This variable is optional, default value is no arameters passed
#       # parameters: ""
#     }
