# Defines the architecture used by the board. It has to be a valid Debian architecture
# like amd64, i386, armhf, mips, ...
#
# Only one architecture can be set at a time, if a board can support several architecture
# armel and armhf, or armhf and arm64, then you need to create several bsp definition file,
# one for each architecture
architecture: armhf

# The kernel section defines the different parameters needed to select and install the kernel
# used to boot the board. It is defined by a source (Debian repository) and a list of packages
# to install (ie: packages containing kernel, dtb, firmware)
#
# Several packages repository are defined in DFT tool and can be used as is. The valid values are
# debian, armbian, devuan and custom. Custom repository can be used, but URL is mandatory
# and must be defined.
