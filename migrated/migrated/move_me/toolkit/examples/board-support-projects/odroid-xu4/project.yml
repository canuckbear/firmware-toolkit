#
# Definition of the project working directories
#
#   The value define hereafter overrides tools default configuration. This
#   mechanism is use to have custom working directories, dedicated to a given
#   project.
#
#   Directories can be defined completly, or partially at project scope. This
#   means that only some of the directories can be redefined. Undefined ones
#   default to the values defined in dft tool configuration
#
#   Some values contains a list of dirctories, for instance 'additional_roles'
#   The list is used to defined exta roles and playbooks, within scope project
#   (thus which are not in the dft open-source scope). Additional directories
#   content is copied to /dft_bootstrap during bootstrap phase, and can be used
#   to install additional oftware nd configuration to the firmware.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
configuration:

  # Defines the root of the working directories. A dirctory named after
  # project name will be created under this path, and subdirectories used to
  # store rootfs, bootchain, image, etc will be created
  # working_dir: "../../working_dir"

  # Defines the path to project configuration files. By default (undefined
  # value) configuration files are searched in the same directory as the
  # current project.yml file
  # project_path: "~/Devel/dft/examples/starter-projects/netshell"

  # Path to the dft installation directory. Default value is /usr/share/dft
  # dft_base: "../ansible"

  # Define a list of directories with additional content (roles, playbooks, etc)
  # which are copied to /dft_bootstrap during rootfs bootstrapping. These paths
  # contains project specific definition (which are not included in the dft
  # open-source tool)
  additional_roles:
    - "../../examples/redefined-roles"

  # Defines if the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10no-check-valid-until should be generated or not
  # If generated this file contains Acquire::Check-Valid-Until: "0"; which disables validity
  # date checking when updating the local repository catalog. Default valueis True
  # generate_validity_check: True

  # Defines if the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10no-check-valid-until should be removed at the end
  # of rootfs generation process. Default value is False
  # remove_validity_check: False


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Definition of the sub configuration files (for rootfs, repositorie, etc.)
#
#   The section can be defined in any order. But inside a definition, the
#   list of yml files is ordered. The files are loaded in the same order as
#   the list. This mechanism is used to overload previous definitions
#
#   If a step is not defined (no yaml configuration file), it will be skipped
#   As an example, if you only want to generate a rootfs and check its content
#   you only have to define :
#   - debootstrap_repository
#   - repositories (if different from debootstrap_repository)
#   - rootfs
#   - check
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
project_definition:

  # Defines the project name. Mostly used for output and directories creation
  project_name: "odroid-xu4"

  # Definition of the repositories used for bootstrapping
  # There can be only one repo, thus its url is defined here
  debootstrap_repository: "http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian"

  # Definition of the repositories to use
  repositories:
    - repositories.yml

  # Definition of the rootfs content
  rootfs:
    - rootfs.yml

  # Definition of the firmware content and structure
  firmware:
    - firmware.yml

  # Definition of the image structure
  image:
    - image.yml

  # Definition of the control to apply on the rootfs
#  check:
#    - check_rootfs.yml

  # Definition of the stripping rules (to remove extra packages, files etc.)
#  stripping:
#    - stripping.yml

  # Definition of the content to generate
#  content_information:
#    - content.yml

  # Definition of the variables to be passed to rootfs creation
  variables:
    - variables.yml
    - variables-xu4.yml

  # Definition of the list of targets, with architectures, versions and optionaly board.
  # Firmware will be generated for each of the architecture in this list
  #
  # version and board are mandatory attributes of the a item definition.
  # bsp_file is an optional attribute used to define the path to a specific bsp file
  # this attribute can be used when the target board is not supprted by DFT and a specific BSP
  # definition has to be passed to the tool. Otherwise the BSP will be loaded from the default
  # DFT installation
  #
  targets:
    - { version: stretch , board: odroid-xu4 }
