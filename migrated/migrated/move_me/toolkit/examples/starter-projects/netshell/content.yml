# Definition of the content information that should be generated by the 
# 'generate_content_information' command from the cli
#
#   There are several kinds of information :
#   . Packages information (package name, version and optionnaly status)
#   . Vulnerabilities information (list of CVE from debecan and DSA database)
#   . Security information, generated by openscan too
#   . Files information (list of file, size, fingerprints)
#   . Anti virus report (execution of a given anti virus for static analysis)
#
#   A dictionnaries named "configuration", controls the output parameters 
#   such has format, file name, etc.
#

#
# The configuratio dictionnary describes the global behavior of the command.
# It contains parameters about output generation such as format, location, etc.
# It also defines what should be done when some tools are missing (debsecan or
# openscap apckages for instance)
#
configuration:
  # The security information generation are run in the chrooted environment.
  # Since the software can be missing, it may be needed to install the software
  # (debsecan). This flag control automatic installation. Default is yes
  # If the packages are installed, they are automatically removed at the end
  # of execution (unless already installed in the baseos). Default is False
  install-missing-software: True

  # In some case it is useful to skip a generation step if software is missing
  # and rootfs modification is not allowed. Setting this variable to True will
  # allow to skip this stage, False will cause the program to abort.
  # Default is True
  # skip-on-missing-software: True

  # The output dictionnary contains all the variable used to control 
  output:
    # This variable control the format of the output. The format available are :
    # - csv
    # - json
    # - yaml
    # - xml
    # 
    format: "csv"

    # The target can be either "stdout" or a "file". When using a file target,
    # the path variable must be defined. Files are stored under content in the
    # project working dir, unless the path is absolute (which means relative 
    # path goes under working_dir/content)
    target: "file"

    # Defines the path under which the oututis stored. If path is relative, 
    # output goes to content directeory in the project tree. If the path is 
    # absolute, then the absolute path is used.
    #
    # Default value is empty, which means all the output goes under content/
    # path: 

    # These three variables defines a prefix and suffix added to the filename, 
    # and a replacement extension. The filename pattern is :
    # <prefix><content-type><suffix>.<format-extension>
    #
    # content-type is one of :
    # - packages
    # - vulnerabilities
    # - security
    # - anti-virus
    # - files
    #
    # default extension value is the formt, default suffix and prefix are empty
    filename-prefix: "prefix"
    filename-suffix: "suffix"
    relace-extension: "dummy"

    # Separtor is needed if the CSV file format is used. It defines the 
    # character oused as field separator
    field-separator: ";"
#
# The packages dictionnary control the list of fields that are included in the 
# output. Default tool used for package information generation is dpkg.
#
packages:
  # If this is set to True (default is True), package name will be included in
  # the information generated
  generate-package-name: True

  # If this is set to True (default is True), package version will be included
  # in the information generated
  generate-package-version: True

  # If this is set to True (default is False), package version will be included
  # in the information generated
  generate-package-description: True

  # If this is set to True (default is False), package status will be included
  # in the information generated
  generate-package-status: True

  # If this is set to True (default is False), package architecture will be 
  # included inthe information generated
  generate-package-architecture: True

  # If this is set to True (default is False), package md5sum (from catalog)
  # will be included inthe information generated
  generate-package-md5: True

  # If this is set to True (default is False), package SHA256 (from catalog)
  # will be included inthe information generated
  generate-package-sha256: True

  # If this is set to True (default is False), package size (from catalog)
  # will be included inthe information generated
  generate-package-size: True

  # If this is set to True (default is False), package installed-size (from
  # catalog) will be included inthe information generated
  generate-package-installed-size: True


#
# The vulnerabilities dictionnary control what is included in the output. 
# Default tool used for package information generation is debsecan.
#
vulnerabilities:
  generate: True

  
#
# The security dictionnary control what is included in the output. 
# Default tool used for package information generation is opnscap.
#
security:
  generate: True

#  
files:
  generate: True
