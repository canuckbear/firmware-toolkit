# Defines the list of files to add and remov from logrotate configuration
# Currently templating is no supported since syntax may be rich. The chosen
# solution is to list the files to remove from standard logrotate installation
# (files will be remove from /etc/logrotate.d), then to list the files to
# add from files/ directory either from dft-logrotate, or from the directory
# copied over dft-logrotate (in order to bring custom configuration)
#
# Files deletion always happens before copying.
#
dft_logrotate:
  # Frequency of log rotation
  frequency: "daily"

  # Nmber of backlogs to keep track of
  rotate_count: 7

  # Create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
  create_new_empty: True

  # Flag to define if you want your log files compressed
  compress: True

  # List the files to remove
  remove_config_files:
    # Removve a dummy configuration file from /etc/logrotate.d/dummy
    -  ppp
  # List the files to add
  add_config_files:
    # Add a sample configuration file from files/saple to /etc/logrotate.d/sample
    -  dummy
