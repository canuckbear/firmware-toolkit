# Defines the default values used to initialize shorewall iptable frontend
#
dft_shorewall:
  #
  # This section controls the content of the /etc/default/shorewall file
  #
  default:
    # set the following varible to 1 in order to allow Shorewall to start
    startup: 1

    # If your Shorewall configuration requires detection of the ip address of a ppp
    # interface, you must list such interfaces in "wait_interface" to get Shorewall
    # to wait until the interface is configured. Otherwise the script will fail
    # because it won't be able to detect the IP address.
    #
    # Example:
    #    wait_interface: "ppp0"
    # wait_interface:

    # Global start/restart options
    options: ""

    # Start options
    start_options: ""

    # Restart options
    restart_options: ""

    # Init Log -- Default is /dev/null, use the STARTUP_LOG defined in shorewall.conf
    # init_log:

    # Set this to 1 to cause '/etc/init.d/shorewall stop' to place the firewall in
    # a safe state rather than to open it. Default value is 0
    # safe_stop:

  #
  # This section controls the content of the /etc/shorewall/params file
  #
  # params:
    # Params contains a list of tuple composed of name and value keys. Each entry
    # defines a variable
    # - name: VARIABLE_1
    #   value: "value of variable 1"
    # - name: VARIABLE_2
    #   value: "value of variable 2"


  #
  # This section controls the content of the /etc/shorewall/policy file
  #
  policy:
    # Params contains a list of tuple composed of source dest and policy (all three are mandatories)
    # and (optionaly) comment, log_level and limit_burst. Each entry defines a policy line
