#
# Definition of the project working directories
#
#   The value define hereafter overrides tools default configuration. This
#   mechanism is use to have custom working directories, dedicated to a given
#   project.
#
#   Directories can be defined completly, or partially at project scope. This
#   means that only some of the directories can be redefined. Undefined ones
#   default to the values defined in dft tool configuration
#
#   Some values contains a list of directories, for instance 'additional_roles'
#   The list is used to defined exta roles and playbooks, within scope project
#   (thus which are not in the dft open-source scope). Additional directories
#   content is copied to /dft_bootstrap during bootstrap phase, and can be used
#   to install additional oftware nd configuration to the firmware.

configuration:

  # Defines the root of the working directories. A directory named after
  # project name will be created under this path, and subdirectories used to
  # store rootfs, bootchain, image, etc will be created
  # working_dir: "/home/foo/working_dir"

  # Path to the dft installation directory. Default value is /usr/share/dft
  dft_base: "/usr/share/dft"

  # Path to the dft bsp definition directory. Default value is /usr/share/dft/bsp
  bsp_base: "/usr/share/dft/bsp"

  # Defines if the debootstrap cache dir should be activated
  activate_debootstrap_cachedir: True

  # Defines the debootstrap cache location
  deboostrap_cachedir: "/var/cache/dft-forge/debootstrap-cachedir"

  # Defines if an apt proxy should be used inside the chrooted environment
  activate_chroot_apt_proxy: True

  # Defines the apt-proxy parameters. It must be a string as defined by apt.
  # It is highly recommanded to use IP adress instead of hostname. According to
  # the roles you use, hostname resolution inside the chroot may not be
  # properly configured yet when proxy will be used. This situation could
  # lead to cache missi or worst errors.
  chroot_apt_proxy: "Acquire::http::proxy \"http://outgoing-proxy:3142\";"

  # Define a list of directories with additional content (roles, playbooks, etc)
  # which are copied to /dft_bootstrap during rootfs bootstrapping. These paths
  # contains project specific definition (which are not included in the dft
  # open-source tool)
  # additional_roles:
  # - "/home/bar/examples/redefined-roles"
