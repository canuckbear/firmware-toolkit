# Defines the architecture used by the board. It has to be a valid Debian architecture
# like amd64, i386, armhf, mips, ...
#
# Only one architecture can be set at a time, if a board can support several architecture
# armel and armhf, or armhf and arm64, then you need to create several bsp definition file,
# one for each architecture
architecture: __BOARD_ARCH__

# The kernel section defines the different parameters needed to select and install the kernel
# used to boot the board. It is defined by a source (Debian repository) and a list of packages
# to install (ie: packages containing kernel, dtb, firmware)
#
# Several packages repository are defined in DFT tool and can be used as is. The valid values are
# debian, armbian, devuan and custom. Custom repository can be used, but URL is mandatory
# and must be defined.

kernel:
  # Defines the upstream site used to provide kernel for this device
  origin: armwizard

  # Defines the public key of the repository if not using default value.
  # Default keys are :

  # pubkey:

  # Parameters for custom origin.
  # Two parameters control the download of the custom repository sining key. There is no
  # default values. Lack of definition will lead to an execution failure.

  # First defines the URL of the repository signing pubkey to download and import
  # pubkey_url: "http://custom.example.com/debian/key.pub"

  # Second defines the fingerprint of the signing pubkey to retrieve and import (it needs to have
  # internet connection and use MIT server as key server)
  # pubkey_gpg: "http://custom.example.com/debian/key.pub"

  # List of packages to install from the repository to add kernel
  packages:
    - linux-kernel-pine64-pinebookpro

  # Defines if the source generated to install kernel packaged should be kept or not after
  # intallation. Default value is True
  # keep_source: True

# The uboot section defines the different parameters needed to select and install the uboot
# used to boot the board an run kernel. It is defined by XXX

  # Defines the upstream site used to provide kernel for this device

  # List of packages to install from the repository to add u-boot.
