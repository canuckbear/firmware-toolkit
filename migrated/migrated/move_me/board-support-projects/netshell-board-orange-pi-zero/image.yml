# Definition of the fileystems to be used in the rootfs. The filesystems
# section defines information wider than the scope of the image itself and its
# partitionning.
#
# File systems includes the definition of the special filesystems like tmpfs,
# and may defines mount point from partition which are not included in the
# image. For instance, the physical target can have a SSD disk attached to it.
# The image itsef would only define the partitioning of the SD card used to
# boot the target. Filesystems could also include infoormation about
# partitions of the SSD disk.
