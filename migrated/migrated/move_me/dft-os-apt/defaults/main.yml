# The dft_os_apt structure controls the generation of sources.list files and APT options such

    # This variable control the generation of the /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10no-check-valid-until file
    # This file (if generated) will deactivate repository age control, allowing to use repositories
    # with invalid (meaning too old) last synchronization date.

    # This is useful when your main repository is not automatically updated from an online official
    # repository. Default value is to generate this file and deactivate the check

  # Default value is not to generate this file. If you activate generation by default, the file
  # generated by the DFT toolkit (target build_rootfs) will be overwrittent by this role.
