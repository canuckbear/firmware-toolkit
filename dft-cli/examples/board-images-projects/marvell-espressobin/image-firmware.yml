#
# Definition of the devices to create. Each device is an image of storage
# block device. The following dictionnaries define a list a device, each
# contains a list of partitions.
#
# Special devices and file systems (such as tmpfs) are not defined inside the
# devices tree structure since they are associated to a physical devices.
# Their definition can be found under the filesystems entry (see below)
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
devices:
  # Defines the size of the device to create. The size value is numerical
  size: "800"

  # Defines the unit used for size. Valid values are :
  # "s" (sectors), "B" (bytes),  "kB",  "MB",  "MiB", "GB",  "GiB",  "TB",  "TiB"
  #
  # Default value is MB
  unit: "MB"

  # Defines the method used fill the empty image file after its creation.
  # Valid values are :
  # . zero    : image is filed with zeros
  # . random  : image is filed with data read from /dev/random)
  # . pattern : the image is filed with repetition of the given pattern (encoded in base64 ?)
  #
  # This attribute is optional, default value is zero
  fill_method: "zero"

  # Defines the filename used to store the device image. This file is created and allocated at
  # image creation.
  filename: "marvell-espressobin-netshell-firmware.img"

  # Defines the kind of compression to apply on the image once its created. Valid values are :
  # . bzip2
  # . gzip
  # . xz
  # . lzma  (euivalent to xz --format=lzma)
  # . none
  #
  # Default value is none, which means no copression at all. The generated image is left unchanged
  # compression: "none"

  # Defines the options to pass to the compressor. The options can be any options supported by the
  # tool used for compression (please check the dedicated man pages for a complete list of options)
  #
  # Default value is no options
  # compression_options: ""

  # Defines which kind of partition table label is used. Valid values are :
  # "aix", "amiga", "bsd", "dvh", "gpt", "loop", "mac", "msdos", "pc98", or "sun"
  #
  # default value is msdos
  label: "msdos"

  # Defines which alignement ype is used for newly created partitions. Valid vaues ares :
  #  . none       Use the minimum alignment allowed by the disk type.
  #  . cylinder   Align partitions to cylinders.
  #  . minimal    Use minimum alignment as given by the disk topology information.
  #  . optimal    Use  optimum  alignment  as  given by the disk topology information.
  #
  # default value is none
  alignment: "optimal"

  # Defines the list of partitions to create inside the device
  partitions:
    - {
        # Name or label of the partition. Supported only by dos, gpt and pc98 tables.
        # Default value is empty name
        name: "system_0" ,

        # Defines the partition type. Valid values are "primary", "logical", or "extended"
        # Default value is primary

        # "%" (percentage of device size)

# The image itsef would only define the partitioning of the SD card used to
